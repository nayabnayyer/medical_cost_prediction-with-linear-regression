# Medical Cost Prediction using Machine Learning 💻💊
This project uses Machine Learning to predict healthcare costs based on patient demographics, medical history, and lifestyle factors. Inspired by the growing need for AI-based solutions in Pakistan's healthcare sector, this project aims to introduce cost prediction models for the first time to help patients and insurance companies estimate medical expenses.

The dataset used is the Medical Cost Personal Dataset from Kaggle. Initially, Linear Regression was implemented, but to achieve better performance and accuracy, the model will be enhanced using Random Forest Regression in future updates.
