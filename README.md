# medical_cost_prediction-with-linear-regression

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict healthcare costs based on patient demographics, medical history, and treatment types. The dataset used is the Medical Cost Personal Dataset from Kaggle. Initially, I implemented Linear Regression, but for more imrpoved performance, I will shift to Random Forest Regression.

The goal is to improve accuracy in predicting medical insurance charges and explore different ML models.
